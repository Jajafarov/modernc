# Modern C
My solutions to the challenges in Jens Gustedt's Modern C.

- Challenge 1 (Sorting)
A simple Mergesort implementation that does most of the sorting in place. Merging needs another array of same size to work as I couldn't figure out a way to do it in place when I was writing it.
- Challenge 2 (Function derivative)
Didn't do this challenge as it wasn't very interesting.
- Challenge 3 (Pi approximation)
A Pi approximation using Ramanujan's coverging infinite series using GMP to do higher precision arithmetic. The output string isn't very well formatted but it is readable.
- Challenge 4 (Union-Find)
A simple union-find implementation that works. I don't think it fully complies with the challenge but I had a hard time fully grasping what the structure of the index table was supposed to be like. Initially started with a 1D array and later moved to a 2D as that was much more efficient.
